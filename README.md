SuperVanish Plugin is a simple tool for Spigot, Paper and Bukkit Minecraft servers to hide you as server-operator/admin

The latest downloads can be found on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/supervanish/versions) 

## How to use:

Get operator rights or the permssions from the `plugin.yml`. Then you are able to make yourself invisible for other players using /vanish. To make vanished players visible type /vanish-show or type /vanish-list to generate a list of vanished players Now you can see vanished players. If you use /supervanish, you are in the supervanish. This means they can't be detected with /vanish-show or /vanish-list.
